# Demo of [database triggered Server Sent Events (SSE) in IHP](https://github.com/digitallyinduced/ihp/pull/1807)

*Sorry, this example uses my fork of IHP [kodeFant/ihp](https://github.com/kodeFant/ihp), so it won't get advantage of Cachix while loading the devenv.*

A proof of concept showing the usage of Server Sent Events with htmx to subscribe to database and hydrating these parts of the page with always up-to-date data, while keeping other parts untouched.
